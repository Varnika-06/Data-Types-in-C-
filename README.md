# Data-Types-in-C++

**Experiment No.: 2**

**Name**: Program on Data Types in C++

**Tools Used**: VS Code

**Theory**: This C++ program demonstrates the use of basic data types (`int, float, string, double, char, bool)` and shows how to accept input, display output, and check memory size using the `sizeof()` operator. It helps understand how data is stored and how much memory each type consumes.

**Algorithm**:

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare variables of types: int, float, string, double, char, bool.

Step 3: For each variable take input

Step 4: Print each variable and its memory size using sizeof().

Step 5: End


**Conclusion**: This program successfully demonstrates how to work with different data types in C++ by accepting user input, displaying the values, and using the sizeof() operator to determine memory usage. It helps in understanding the storage size and behavior of fundamental data types, which is essential for efficient memory management and type selection in programming.
